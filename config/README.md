# Config Service

[Spring Cloud Config](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html) is horizontally scalable centralized configuration service for distributed systems. It uses a pluggable repository layer that currently supports local storage, Git, and Subversion. 

In this project, I use `native profile`, which simply loads config files from the local classpath. You can `shared` directory in Config service resource.
